1. All threads shared one cache and it stores everything in memory.
    If there is a malformed website that contains a huge page, then may exceed memory size and cause program crash.
    Better way is write cache from memory to database.

2. Did not set up a detection on connection time for CONNECT and for receiving data.
    If there is a malformed website (like google :) )that always active, there will be always an active thread which
    will occupy server resource. If there is a malformed connection that always keep sending useless data
    also will cause danger.

3. LOG system requires super user permission.
    May cause unexpected danger.

4. SET a constant cache size which is 100.

5. SET a constant port which is 12345.
